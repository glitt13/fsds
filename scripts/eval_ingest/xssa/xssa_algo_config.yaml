# Config for training and testing algorithms that predict formulation metrics or hydrologic signatures based on catchment attributes
algorithms: # REQUIRED. Refer to AlgoTrainEval.train_algos to see what options are present (e.g. rf, mlp)
  rf:  # STRONGLY RECOMMENDED. Refer to sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor for arguments to pass here. Otherwise defaults will be used
    - n_estimators: 400 #[50,100,200,300,400]
    - forestci: True # Boolean. Forestci model to calculate confidence interval for rf model.
  mlp:  # OPTIONAL. Refer to sklearn.neural_network.MLPRegressor for arguments to pass here. Otherwise defaults will be when 'mlp' is specified here
    - hidden_layer_sizes: (4,) # expect a tuple for hidden_layer_sizes, which will be interpreted as a string literal
    - activation: relu
    - solver: lbfgs
    - alpha: [0.0001,0.001,0.01,0.1]
    - batch_size: auto
    - learning_rate: constant
    - power_t: 0.5
    - max_iter: [20000,80000,160000]
test_size: 0.3 # The proportion of dataset for testing, passed to sklearn.train_test_split
seed: 32 # the random seed
name_attr_config: 'xssa_attr_config.yaml'  # REQUIRED. Name of the corresponding dataset's attribute configuration file, which should be in the same directory as this. If not provided, assumes 'attr' may be substituted for this filename's 'algo'
name_attr_csv:  # OPTIONAL. If provided, read this .csv file to define attributes used for training algorithm(s). Default None means use the attributes from the attr config file.
colname_attr_csv: # OPTIONAL. But REQUIRED if name_attr_csv provided. The column name containing the attribute names. Default None.
verbose: True # Boolean. Should the train/test/eval provide printouts on progress?
read_type: 'filename' # Optional. Default 'all'. Should all parquet files be lazy-loaded, assign 'all' otherwise just files with comids_resp in the file name? assign 'filename'. Defaults to 'all'
MAPIE_alpha: [90, 95, 99] # OPTIONAL. Enabled if not empty. Confidence levels in an array format to calculate MAPIE prediction intervals. If empty, MAPIE is not calculated.
Bagging_uncertainty:  # 
    - n_algos: 10 # OPTIONAL. Enabled if not empty. Number of bootstrap runs for Bagging confidence interval calculation. Bagging ci calculation is disabled if n_algos is empty.
    - confidence_levels: [90,95,99] # OPTIONAL. But REQUIRED if a value is assinged to n_algos. Confidence interval for bootstrap ci calculation in an array format.
